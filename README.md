# Mall Customer Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing mall customer data to understand spending patterns, segment customers, and derive valuable business insights. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.  

## üìä Dataset  
The dataset contains customer information, including:  
- **Customer ID** ‚Äì Unique identifier for each customer  
- **Gender** ‚Äì Male or Female  
- **Age** ‚Äì Age of the customer  
- **Annual Income (k$)** ‚Äì Annual income in thousands of dollars  
- **Spending Score (1-100)** ‚Äì A score assigned based on customer spending behavior  

## üèÜ Objectives  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends  
- Apply **customer segmentation** techniques (e.g., K-Means clustering)  
- Visualize customer distribution using charts and graphs  
- Provide business recommendations based on insights  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## üìà Key Insights  
The project helps identify high-value customers, budget shoppers, and average spenders. These insights can be used by mall management to improve marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and boost sales.
